### APPL Checklist
This is a list of steps required to mature APPL to full maturity, not in any particular order.

- Implement JSON Parsing (for package creation)
- Find a FOSS Database for storing a local package registry
    - Could also implement a custom file format (appdb)
- Progress bar for downloads
- Package Groups (very high priority)
- Ability to download multiple packages at once
- Add checksum verifying 
- Gather a small library of AppImages for distribution
