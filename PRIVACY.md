### APPL does not collect *any* data besides items explicitly provided to us by you, the end user.
I will not collect any data (including basic telemetry like kernel version and hardware specs) unless you report an issue with said data or agree to send diagnostics. Any data submitted in an issue will solely be used for the purpose of resolving the issue and will not be stored in any location other than the issue. Explicitly submitted data for diagnostics will only be used for the purpose of improving the project and is entirely anonymous.

### You are completely anonymous
Any data will be submitted under a randomized UUID. Said UUID will reset immediately after every submission and is only used for linking data to diagnose and extinguish critical issues.

Any and all data may be deleted at any time, for any reason. You dont need to provide any information to delete data. To request deletion, run `appl uuid` to get your current UUID and `appl reqdel *uuid*` to request deletion.
